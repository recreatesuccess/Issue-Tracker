# Issue-Tracker

Issue Tracker is a web application built from scratch with Javascript. This project allowed me to work with C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users are able to add issues with an assigned priority level. 

This one page application has a clean design, with a focus on an enhanced user experience.
